          <div class="Grid_container">
            <div1><h1>White Bread</h1><img src="WhiteBread.jpg" alt="WhiteBread" id="Starting_with"><p>Many people think of plain white bread when they envision a loaf. This bread is made with all-purpose or bread flour, or a combination of the two, and is usually soft, fluffy and perfect for sandwiches.</p> </div1>
            <div2><h1>Sourdough Bread</h1><img src="Sourdough-Bread.jpg" alt="Sourdough-Bread" height="300"><p>Sourdough doesnt use packaged yeast but instead relies on wild yeasts that occur naturally. To make sourdough you’ll need a sourdough starter or a banneton basket, but the added effort is worth it when you take a bite of that tangy, chewy slice.</p></div2>
            <div3><h1>Wheat Bread</h1><img src="Wheat_Bread.jpg" alt="Wheat_Bread" height="300"><p>Since whole wheat flour still contains the nutritious components of the wheat kernel, whole wheat bread is thought to be better for your body than white bread. Plus, it’s more sturdy than a bread made with just white flour. Whichever one you go with, you’re going to want to know how to keep bread fresh.</p></div3>
